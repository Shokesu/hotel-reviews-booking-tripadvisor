In a way I was convalescing and I found the hostel comfortable enough. \rI know summer in Finland is generally very warm, but sometimes not so warm, therefore when I  visit Finland in summer I always take some warm clothes with me. My last visit was one of those cold ones.and my `hotwaterbottle` and woolly socks turned out to be very useful. Otherwise the nights would have been a bit too cold for me, because the quilt  was a bit thin and there was no extra quilts or blankets in the cupboards. Otherwise the room was reasonably well equipped. The broomcupboard - very useful!\rI`d like to take this opportunity to thank the Hostel and all the staff for being so helpful and kind and understanding for an old lady like me, constantly at the reception asking for something. \rI so hope to see you all again next year!! -kaisu stanford-", "score": "9.6", "tags": "", "negative_content": "I find it absolutely impossible to say anything negative about this hostel.
